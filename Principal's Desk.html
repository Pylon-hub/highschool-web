    <h4 style="font:size 50px;color:blanchedalmond">If it's to be it is up to me and succes is not for the chosen.When
        it comes to succeeding in life there are
        three basics mindsets that people tend to have.<br>These are win/loss mentality.People with a wi or lose
        mentality
        and the win/win mentality.People with a win/lose mentality would be those that compare themselves to other
        people all the time.<br>They belief that inoder for them to succeedothers must fail.To them,success is
        relative.Those with a lose/lose mentality belief that they can never achieve anything worthwhile so why should
        they let you do so.<br>They try to let other people into sinking boat that they are in.They suffer from pulling
        other people down syndrome.Negativity is the order of the day for them.<br>Don't ever try to tell such people
        that
        you have great plans for your life-they will only criticize you and tell you it can't be done.After all they
        tried and already it did not work.Success is individual.</h4>
